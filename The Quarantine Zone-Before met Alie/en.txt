Joel:  I'm coming!

Tess: How was your morning?  Want one?

Joel: No, I don't… want one.
官译：不，不用了
私译：不，我不想喝一杯

Tess:  Well, I have some interesting news for you.

Joel:  Where were you, Tess?

Tess:  West End district. Hey, we had a drop to make… 

Joel:  We. We had a drop to make. 

Tess: Yeah, well, you wanted to be left alone, remember? 

Joel: So I'll take a guess. The, uh, whole deal went south and the client made off with our pills. Is that about right?

Tess:  Deal went off without a hitch.  Enough ration cards to last us a couple of months—easy.

Joel: You wanna explain this? 

Tess: I was on my way back here, and I got jumped by these two assholes, all right?  And yeah, they got a good few hits in, but… Look, I managed.
官译：他们还挺厉害的，
私译：他们还挺能打的，我搞定了

Joel:  Gimme that…  Are these assholes still with us?

Tess:  Now that's funny…
官译：这就有趣了
私译：那就搞笑了

Joel: Did you at least find out who they were?

Tess: Yeah, look, they were a couple of nobodies,  they don't matter. What matters is that Robert fucking sent them.
官译：[]
私译：他妈的


Joel:  Our Robert?
官译：我们认识的罗伯特
私译：我们的罗伯特

Tess: He knows that we're after him.  He figures he's gonna get us first?

Joel:  That son of a bitch, he's smart.

Tess: No.  He's not smart enough. I know where he's hiding.

Joel: Like hell you do.
官译：你还挺厉害
私译：这才像你做的

Tess: Old warehouse in Area 5.  Can't say for how long, though.

Joel:  Well, I'm ready now. Yeah?

Tess: Oh, I can do now.

Tess: The checkpoint's still open.

Joel: Only got a few hours left until curfew.

Tess: We better hurry up then.

Male civilian: Wait, are you serious?

Female civilian: I got served the damn papers this morning. I've been selected for outside work duty.

Male civilian: It's such crap. The soldiers are supposed to handle the outside.

Female civilian:  I'll make sure to tell them that.

Female civilian:  What about you, Joel? You been summoned for this bullshit yet?

Joel: Nope.

Tess: Joel and I always seem to get lucky.

Female civilian: Yeah… I bet.

PA system: Attention. Citizens are required to carry a current ID at all times. Compliance with all city personnel is mandatory. 

Tess: Look at that. Ration line hasn't opened yet. Must be running low again.

Female civilian: Hey. How much longer?

Male soldier: Lady, when the rations arrive, we'll open the door. All right?

Male civilian 1:  I hear it's another half ration week.

Male civilian 2: Are you fucking kidding me? That's three weeks in a row now.

Male civilian 1: Well, what're you gonna do?

Male civilian 2: This is such fucking bullshit. I bet those uniforms over there, they don't get half rations.

Male civilian 1:  Keep your voice down. What's wrong with you?

Male civilian 2: Whatever, I don't even care anymore. Let 'em take me.

Male civilian 1: Just… be quiet.

Male soldier 1: Let's go.

Male civilian 1:  You leave me alone!

Male soldier 1:  Down on the ground.

Male civilian 2: Okay, okay.  Jesus.

Male soldier 1:  I said get down.

Male civilian 1:  I didn't do anything wrong!

Male soldier 2:  Hands on your fucking head. Do it.  All right, scan 'em.

Male soldier 1: He's clean.  Clean.  Got a live one.

Female civilian: No.  I'm not infected!

Male soldier 3: Ah, shit. Hold her down. 

Female civilian: It's wrong. The scan's wrong!

Male soldier 1:  Do it.

Female civilian:  Please!

Male soldier 1:  Eyes forward.

Male soldier 2:  All right, she's down.

Male civilian 3: Fuck this!

Male soldier 1:  Stop!

Male civilian 2:  Holy shit. Holy shit.

Male soldier 1: Shut up! Consider yourself lucky. That's what happens when you hide out in a condemned building.  Call the clean up crew.

Male soldier 2:  We're through here. Gonna need two bags and two more for the box.

Male soldier 4:  All right, people, this isn't a show. Keep moving along.

Male soldier 2:  Yes, sir. We'll stay put.  They're on their way. Shouldn't be long.

Tess: Seems like more people are gettin' infected.

Joel: That just means more people are sneakin' out.

Male civilian: Where's Mark at?

Ronnie: You didn't hear? They caught him trying to use fake ration cards.

Male civilian: Jesus. What'd they do?

Ronnie: What do you think? They beat the shit out of him and dragged him off. Haven't heard from him since.

Male civilian: Oh, fucking idiot. Should've known better.

Ronnie: He's got a family. What's the guy gonna do?

Male civilian: Yeah? How's that working out for him now?

Ronnie:  Hey asshole, what are you looking at?

Male civilian: Ronnie, shut the fuck up, man.  Hey, Joel. We're not looking for trouble, okay?

Joel: No harm, no foul. 

Male civilian:  What the hell's wrong with you? Do you know who that is?

Ronnie: Psh, whatever, man.

Male civilian: 'Sup, Joel?

Joel:  Howdy.

Male civilian: You hear they took Maryanne?

Female civilian: What happened?

Male civilian: Came and snatched her in the middle of the night. Said she was a Firefly. You believe that shit?

Female civilian:  Better not mention the Fireflies too loudly. You don't want the wrong person hearing you.

Male civilian: Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

Female soldier: They fuckin' lynched 'em.

Male soldier: The entire squad?

Female soldier: Yeah. Way I heard it, they lined them up in the street and cut 'em up. Retribution and shit. We ever lose control of this place to the stragglers, that's what'll happen to us.

Male soldier: That will never go down here. Any straggler even looks at me the wrong way, I put his ass down.

Female soldier:  I'm sure that's what they thought at every other QZ before riots broke out.

Male soldier: It's those goddamn Fireflies. They keep stirring the population up. We put an end to 'em. That's how you solve this shit.

Female soldier: We agree on that.

Male civilian: They died right in front of me. Damn runners came out of nowhere. What am I supposed to tell their families?

Male soldier: Checkpoint's to your left, sir.

Tess: I got us all new papers. They shouldn't give us any static up there. Just play it cool. 

Male soldier 1:  All right, drive on through.

Male soldier 1:  Let me see your IDs.

Joel: There you go. 

Male soldier 1:  What's your business here? 

Joel: Got the day off. Visiting a friend.

Male soldier 1:  All right, move on through.

Joel: Thanks.

Tess: Oh shit.

Male soldier 1:  Get outta here. Go!  Close it up!

Male soldier 2: Fireflies! 

Male soldier 3: Fuckin' shoot 'em! 

Male soldier 1: They're running!  Call for backup! 

Tess: Joel, come on, let's get outta here. 

PA system: Attention. Checkpoint 5 is now closed until further notice. All civilians must clear the surrounding area immediately. 

Tess: Joel, let's go. C'mon.

Joel:  Goddamn Fireflies.

Tess:  Looks like the coast is clear. C'mon.

Tess: Fuck… so much for the easy route. Patch yourself up, all right?

Tess: They're gonna close all the checkpoints. We're gonna have to go around the outside.

Joel: Outside the wall?

Tess:  Or we could just let Robert go.

Joel:  Cute.
官译：你真会说笑	
私译：搞笑

Male civilian: Hey, Tess. You see that shit?
官译：你看到那个了吗
私译：你看见那玩意了吗

Tess: I was there.  Hey, how's the east tunnel looking?

Male civilian: It's clear. I just used it. No patrols. Where you off to?

Tess: Gonna pay Robert a visit.

Male civilian:  You too?

Tess: Who else is looking for him?

Male civilian: Uh, Marlene. She's been asking around, trying to find him.

Tess: Marlene? What do the Fireflies need with Robert?

Male civilian: You think she'd tell me?

Tess: Well, what did you tell her?

Male civilian: The truth. I got no idea where he's hiding.

Tess: Good man. Hey, you stay out of trouble, all right? Military's gonna be out in force soon.
官译：好家伙
私译：很好

Male civilian: Yeah, see you around.

Tess:  Marlene lookin' for Robert? What do you make of that?

Joel: I don't like it. We better find him before the Fireflies do.
官译：我有不好的预感
私译：我觉的不妙

Tess: This is us.

Male guard: Hey, guys. How's it going?

Tess: Shit's stirring up out there. How we lookin' over here?

Male guard: Ah, it's been quiet. No signs of military or infected.

Tess: That's what I like to hear.  Joel, give me a hand with this.
官译：那就好
私译：这就是我想听到的

Male guard: Y'all take it easy out there.

Beyond the Wall
Tess: Argh, God, this place reeks. They need to watch what they throw away down here.  Let there be light.

Tess: Let's grab our gear.

Tess: Our backpacks are still here from last time.

Joel:  Not a lot of ammo. 

Tess: Well, make your shots count.

Tess: All right, Texas. Boost me up.

Tess:  Wanna boost me up?

Tess: You ready?

Joel: Yes, ma'am.

Tess: C'mon.

Joel: Go on.

Tess: Got it.

Joel: Be careful.

Tess: When am I not?

Joel:  That a trick question?

Joel: Ain't been out here in a while.

Tess:  It's like we're on a date.
官译：我们好像在约会
私译：好像在约会一样

Joel: Well I am the romantic type.
官译：我这个人还挺浪漫的
私译：我是浪漫型的

Tess: You got your ways.

Tess:  Where's the ladder?

Joel: It's gotta be around here somewhere. 

Tess:  Hey, try over there.  No ladder here.  Check that back area.

Joel:  Got it.

Tess: Great. Bring it over.

Joel: Ladies first.

Tess:  Lady? You must be thinking of someone else.
官译：我哪里像个女士?
私译：你肯定指的是别人

Joel:  It's all relative.
官译：多少像点
私译：相对而言

Tess: This way.

Tess: Down through here.

Tess: You think Robert's still got our guns?

Joel: For his sake… he better.

Tess: Look, once we get our merchandise back, it should be easy to unload.

Joel: Speaking of merchandise, when's that next shipment due?

Tess: Well, we're meeting Bill next month; more pills, lots of ammo, supposedly.

Joel: Yeah, well he always shows up with somethin'. Should keep us busy for a while.

Tess: Hold up. Spores.

Joel:  Where the hell are all these comin' from? Place was clear last time.

Tess: They're coming outta somethin'. Stay alert.

Joel: There's our culprit.

Tess: Pfft. Body's not that old. Better keep your eyes and ears open.

Joel: We should be able to fit through here.

Joel: Oh, shit.

Tess:  You okay?

Joel: Yeah  Damn ceiling's falling apart. Be careful.

Joel: This way.  Easy.

Joel:  Jesus.  Watch it. Watch it. 

Male smuggler:  Help me…  My mask broke. Don't… Don't leave me to turn.  Please. 

Tess:  What do you wanna do?

Male smuggler:  Come back…  Don't—  Don't leave me like this. Come back!

Tess:  Poor bastard.

Tess: Up ahead. You hear that?

Joel: Shh, shh, shh.

Tess:  How you wanna handle it?

Joel: Jesus.

Tess: All right, that's all of 'em.

Joel: Let's hope so.

Tess: Let's head back into the city.

Joel:  They got infected trying to sneak into the zone.

Tess: Tsh. As much as everyone complains about it, you got all these poor bastards wishing they were living on the inside.

Tess:  Ahhh… Some fresh air. That's the one thing I love about the outside. Fuckin' hate the smell of the city.

Joel: Why don't you ask Bill to get you some of them air fresheners?

Tess:  Hey, if they weren't expired, that'd be a good idea.

Tess:  Through here.

Joel:  After you.

Tess: Cover the entrance.

Joel:  I got it.

Tess:  Damn it. Plank fell down.  Be a dear, would you?

Joel:  I'll get it.

Tess: Here. Pass it to me.

Joel: It's a bit heavy.

Tess:  I think I can handle it. 

Joel: All right.

Tess: There we go.  Get your ass up here. Let's move.

Joel: Bossy today.

Tess: We're gettin' close.

Joel: Let's make sure there aren't any soldiers around.

Tess:  It's clear. C'mon.

Tess: Shut it.

Tess: Hey, little man.  Make sure the coast is clear?  No soldiers. None of Robert's men. Yeah?

Joel:  You know he's expecting us.

Tess: Well, that'll make it more interesting. 

Tess: Good to go. C'mon.

The Slums

Terrance: Hey, Tess. Hey, Tess. Hey, pretty lady, how you doin' today? I heard you got some merchandise—

Tess: Not right now, Terrance. 

Terrance: No, no, no, it's good. Look, I got the card.

Tess: Not. Now. You hear me?

Terrance: Okay. I can do that.  Don't get all huffy-puffy about it.

Female vendor: If you ain't got ration cards, don't even waste my time. I'm not interested in bartering for bullets.

Female civilian 1: Hurry up. We're starving.

Male vendor:  Keep your shirt on. Next batch comin' right up.

Female civilian 2:  Hey, don't even think about cutting in line.

Male civilian: Fuckin' A. Been waiting on this rat forever.

Male vendor:  Sorry, man. These dogs are all accounted for. Sold out in less than an hour. Try me next week.

Male civilian: You touch it, you buy it.

Male civilian: Tess, it's been a while. You don't visit us anymore.

Female civilian: Who the hell is that?

Male civilian: None of your damn business.

Male civilian: Private game, buddy. Scram.

Malick: Where do you think you're goin'?

Tess:  Malick. Sit back down.

Malick: Oh, sorry, Tess. Didn't realize you two were together. Go ahead.

Joel: Who's that?

Tess: An old headache. Don't ask.

Male civilian: What do you want?

Male civilian: That guy's been hoarding all sorts of shit in that factory.

Female civilian:  Whoa, whoa, hold up, man.

Male civilian: Yeah, yeah.

Tess: I'm lookin' for Robert.  He come through here?

Male civilian: Half hour ago. He went back to the wharf. He's there now.

Joel:  Here we go.

Tess: Let us through.

Male thug 1: You guys need to turn around and head back if you know what's good for you.

Tess: Our beef isn't with you. We just want Robert. You don't want to do this.
官译：我劝你死了这条心
私译：你没必要这么做

Male thug 1:  Turn the fuck around and leave now.

Tess: I'm not going anywhere without Robert.
官译：没有找到罗伯特我是不会走的
私译：没找到罗伯特我哪儿也不去

Male thug 1: Bitch,  I will bash your skull unless you turn around and get your dumbass outta here.

Tess:  Fuck this.
官译：妈的
私译：去他妈的

Male thug 2: Take cover!

Tess:  You ready?

Joel: Yeah.

Male thug 3:  I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

Tess: I'll cover you. Get the angle on them.
官译：伺机进攻
私译：找好角度

Tess: Nicely done, Texas.

Joel: You too. How the hell did he get all these guys?

Tess: If Robert's good at one thing, it's writing blank checks. Let's go put an end to that.

Tess: Shit. Not goin' through here.  Hey, boost me up.

Joel: All right,  c'mon…

Tess: Gimme your hand.

Tess: There you go.

Joel:  All right.

Tess:  Over here, Joel.

Tess: Pfft. More of Robert's guys.

Joel: Shit, I seem 'em.

Male thug 1: How do you know they're coming?

Male thug 2: Two of our guys died trying to take Tess out.  I guarantee that she and Joel are on their way here right now to get Robert.

Male thug 1: Jesus. We shouldn't've taken this job.

Male thug 2: Not our call. Let's spread out and make sure no one's creeping around in here.

Tess:  Nice and quiet, Texas.

Tess:  Move up. Move up.
官译：快点，快点
私译：搞起，搞起

Male thug 3: I meant to tell you, I was down on Jordan Street, and all these soldiers showed up with a group of about five civs, all in handcuffs.

Male thug 4: Let me guess, Fireflies?

Male thug 3: Yup, they lined 'em up against the wall and bang, bang, bang, they just executed all of 'em.

Male thug 4: Phew. Holy shit.

Male thug 3: Yeah, I hear it's like that all over the city. They're cracking down on 'em hard.

Male thug 4:  I got a cousin with 'em.

Male thug 3: Seriously?

Male thug 4: Yeah. Idiot thinks he's gonna save the world.  Hope's he's all right.

Tess:  You take one out, I'll take the other.

Tess: There's another one. Over there.

Tess: Let's search the area.

Male thug 1: Hey, we consolidated the crates in the South warehouse. Supplies are locked up.

Male thug 2: Good, let's do another once over and then head out. It's getting close to curfew. 

Male thug 1: What about Robert? Who's he holing up with tonight? Guy's too paranoid to stay here by himself.

Male thug 2: Fuck if I know. We'll check in with the others and come up with something.

Male thug 1: Okay.

Tess: We shoulda brought more people.

Joel: They'd just slow us down.

Tess: Yeah, you're right.  C'mon, the docks are this way. Let's do this.

Tess: There's our boy.
官译：我们要找的人在那儿呢。
私译：这小子这儿呢

Tess:  That cocky son of a bitch.

Joel:  Let's go wrap this up.

Tess: Let's be smart about this. There's a lot of 'em.
官译：这儿有很多机会
私译：这儿人很多 

Male thug 1: Shipments have been dry for a long time.

Male thug #2: Yeah, well we lost our contacts in the North, lost our contacts in the South.  Shit, I don't know who's left out there to sell us stuff. Guess this is why we're taking shitty protection jobs.

Male thug 1:  Fucking Robert. That rat better be good for it.

Male thug 2: Even if he is, then what? I'm telling you, this zone is done for. We better think of an exit strategy.

Male thug 1:  You're insane. Going outside the wall is suicide.

Male thug 2: Plenty of the other smugglers do it. What do you think's gonna happen here once supplies run out?

Male thug 1: I'd still take my chances in here.

Joel: This guy's wheeling and dealing with everyone in town.

Joel: Well, leave it to Robert to piss everyone off.

Tess: That office. Robert must've run in there. Let's go.

Robert: Oh, shit!  Get back! Get the fuck back!

Tess:  We just wanna talk Robert.

Robert:  We ain't got fuckin' nothin' to talk about! 

Tess: Put your gun down!

Robert: Yeah… Go fuck yourself!

Tess: He's running! 

Joel:  Robert!

Robert:  Screw you, Joel!

Tess:  Joel, this way!  C'mon. He ran in here!

Tess: Over here.  We almost got him!

Robert:  C'mon. C'mon!

Tess:  Joel, this way!  Joel. He's right there!

Tess: Well, hello, Robert.

Robert:  Tess. Joel. No hard feelings, right?

Tess:  None at all. 

Robert:  All right…

Robert:  Ah… Goddammit!

Tess:  We missed you.

Robert: Look, whatever it is you heard, it ain't true, okay? I—I just want to say—

Tess: The guns. You wanna tell us where the guns are?

Robert:  Yeah, sure, but… i-it's complicated, all right?

Robert: Look, all right, just hear me out on this. I got—  Ah, fuck!  Ah, stop! Stop! Stop! 

Tess:  Quit your squirming.  You were saying?

Robert:  I sold 'em…

Tess: Excuse me?

Robert: I didn't have much of a choice. I owed someone.

Tess: You owed us! I'd say you bet on the wrong horse.

Robert: I just need more time. Just gimme a week.

Tess: You know, I might've done that if you hadn't tried to fucking kill me.

Robert: C'mon, it wasn't like—

Tess: Who has our guns?!

Robert:  I can't…

Robert: Look, just give me a couple of da—

Robert: Fucking…

Tess: Who. Has. Our guns?

Robert:  It's the Fireflies. I owed the Fireflies!

Tess: What?

Robert: Look. They're basically all dead. W-we can just—just go in there, finish 'em off. We get the guns! What do ya say?  C'mon! Fuck those Fireflies!  Let's go get 'em!

Tess:  That is a stupid idea.

Joel:  Well, now what?

Tess: We go get our merchandise back.

Joel:  How?

Tess: I don't know. We… explain it to them. Look, let's… let's go find a Firefly.

Marlene: You won't have to look very far.

Joel: There you go, Queen Firefly.

Marlene: Why are you here?

Tess: Business.  You aren't looking so hot.

Marlene:  Where's Robert?

Marlene:  I needed him alive.

Tess: The guns he gave you? They weren't his to sell, and I want them back.

Marlene: Doesn't work like that, Tess.

Tess: The hell it doesn't.

Marlene:  I paid for those guns. You want 'em back? You're gonna have to earn 'em.

Tess:  How many cards are we talkin' about?

Marlene:  I don't give a damn about ration cards.  I need something smuggled out of the city. You do that - I'll give you your guns back and then some.

Joel: How do we know you got 'em?  Way I hear it, the military's been wiping you guys out.
官译：追捕
私译：消灭

Marlene:  You're right about that. I'll show you the weapons.

Male soldier 1:  Search the area.

Male soldier 2:  Yes, sir.

Marlene: I gotta move. What's it gonna be? 

Tess:  I wanna see those guns. 

Marlene: Follow me.
